# MayaTok
MayaTok is a blazing-fast, multithreaded Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenizer written in Rust. Built with performance and extensibility in mind, it‚Äôs ideal for anyone working on custom LLM pipelines, research, or production-ready NLP infrastructure.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Version: **V1** (under development, more optimizations & token compression coming soon!)

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Features

Custom BPE tokenizer from scratch
 
Multithreaded training for fast vocab generation 

Persistent merges 

Checkpoint saving

Focus on raw speed ‚Äî built for performance benchmarking



Make sure you have Rust installed. If not, [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AlgoBrother/MayaTok-BPE.git
cd mayatok-bpe
maturin build --release
```

This will generate the optimized binary in target/release/mayatok.

## üì• Download Pretrained Vocab

Download the trained vocab and merges: 

**Note: If you wish to make your own Vocab please see** [create_your_own_vocab](examples/train_your_own_vocab.py)

### Using Curl

```bash
curl -O https://huggingface.co/datasets/AlgoBrother/mayatok-assets/resolve/main/bpe_tokenizer_py.json
```

### Using Invoke-WebReques 

```bash
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://huggingface.co/datasets/AlgoBrother/mayatok-assets/resolve/main/bpe_tokenizer_py.json -OutFile bpe_tokenizer_py.json
```

## Corpus Used for V1

Cosmopedia

OpenWebText

## Using with Python

To use MayaTok with python. 

```bash
pip install target/wheels/<PATH>
```
> Replace <PATH> with the file version you have downloaded. Locate under target\wheels\ and copy and paste its path after ```pip install```

Now you can use mayatok in your project :)

```python
import mayatok_bpe as bpe

my_tokenizer = bpe.PyBPETokenizer.load("bpe_tokenizer_py.json")
test = "Hello, world!"
tokens = my_tokenizer.encode(test)
print(tokens)
decoded_text = my_tokenizer.decode(tokens)
print(decoded_text)
```

Output of the sample code above
```
[732, 21843, 345, 535, 576, 335, 725]
Hello , world !
```
